# TODO

This file is intended to be used as a list of things that will be added to Novusk in the near future. If you think
there's something that needs to be added or improved you can add it to this list. Features that are directly related to 
the kernel (arch specific, main kernel, etc..) should go under the ``Essential`` section, for features that are not 
directly related to the kernel (device specific support, user libraries, etc...) should go under ``Non essential`` 
unless there is a good reason for it being under ``Essential``.

Example:

```
### Non essential

- [ ] Add new API feature
    - People invovlved: @Me, @MyBestFriend, @MyBestFriendsBestFriend
    - Issue: [issue/pr #N](link[s])
```

### Essential

- [ ] ARM (32 bit) kernel rewrite
  - Part of Novusk v3 Rewrite
- [ ] ARM (64 bit) kernel rewrite
  - Part of Novusk v3 Rewrite

### Non essential

- [ ] Novusk v3 Rewrite - This will be continuously worked on
