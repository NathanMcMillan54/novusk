# Android development on x86

### Start a new project:
```commandline
cargo new novusk_android && cd novusk_android/
cargo new kernel --lib && curl "some x86 compiled android image" > kernel/androidimage
```

Create a new project and add a compiled Android image to it.

### Setup Novusk:

Edit your ``Cargo.toml``
```toml
[dependencies.x86]
git = "https://github.com/NathanMcMillan54/novusk/"
path = "arch/x86/"
features = ["android_box"]
```

The required functions are still needed, but it doesn't really matter what their return values are. Functions that deal
with initramfs.

Link Android with Novusk in a build script using ``Path`` and ``copy``. Then in ``kernel/src/lib.rs`` add the normal 
Novusk OS stuff:

```rust
// kernel/src/mod:
#![no_std]

#[macro_use] extern crate libnu;

extern "C" {
    fn start_android() -> !;
}

#[no_mangle]
pub unsafe extern "C" fn kernel_main() -> ! {
    println!("Starting Android kernel...");
    start_android()
}
```

You will have to write most of the drivers but Novusk will have enough for a very dumbed-down version of Android.
