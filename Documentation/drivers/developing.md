Drivers a very important to a kernel and operating system, without them it would be completely unusable and useless. 
This will talk about resources that can be used for writing drivers for Novusk and how they should be written.

### novuskinc

[novuskinc](https://github.com/new-kernel/novuskinc) is a library that is used for many things in Novusk. It is used for
writing and interacting with drivers. It's documentation can be found 
[here](https://new-kernel.github.io/novuskinc/novuskinc). It has functions, structs, and traits that a driver needs to
implement which can give you an idea on how a certain driver should be written.

In this directory there are documentation files that explain how to write some specific drivers.
